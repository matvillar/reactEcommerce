# Development Environment

To develop our eCommerce Template, we used the following tools:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VSC)**:

   - _Description_: A powerful and versatile code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
   - _Usage_: Used for writing, editing, and debugging the project's code.

2. **GitHub**:

   - _Description_: A web-based version control and collaboration platform for software development. It is built on Git and offers additional features such as issue tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for documentation.
   - _Usage_: Served as our primary platform for source code management, collaboration, and version control.

3. **Jira**:

   - _Description_: A project management tool designed for software development teams. It is widely used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and agile project management.
   - _Usage_: Used to organize, prioritize, and track the progress of our work throughout the software development lifecycle.

4. **ChatGPT**:

   - _Description_: An AI language model developed by OpenAI, capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on the input it receives.
   - _Usage_: Assisted in generating ideas, providing coding insights, and clarifying technical concepts during development.

5. **Lucidchart**:

   - _Description_: A free resource online that helps design website mockups with ease.
   - _Usage_: Used for creating various diagrams including architectural diagrams, flowcharts, and database schemas to aid in planning and visualization of the project structure.

6. **Microsoft Teams**:

   - _Description_: A communication and collaboration platform that combines chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration.
   - _Usage_: Facilitated team communication, meetings, and discussions, ensuring seamless coordination among team members.

7. **MongoDB Compass**:
   - _Description_: The official graphical user interface for MongoDB. It allows you to visually explore your data, run queries, and interact with your database.
   - _Usage_: Used to manage and debug MongoDB databases, providing a clear view of the database structure and content for our project.

We used the following programming languages and associated libraries to develop our template:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:

   - _Usage_: Used to structure the content on the web pages of our application. It forms the backbone of our frontend design.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:

   - _Usage_: Employed to style the HTML content, including layout designs, fonts, colors, and responsive design elements, making our application visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **JavaScript**:

   - _Usage_: The primary programming language used to create dynamic and interactive elements on the frontend. JavaScript is pivotal in enhancing the user experience and interactivity of our web application.

4. **MERN Stack**:

   - _Components_: MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, representing a full-stack development framework.
   - _Usage_:
     - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store our application data.
     - **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building our application's backend and API.
     - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily used for constructing the frontend of our application.
     - **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment that executes our server-side JavaScript code.

5. **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating)**:

   - _Usage_: A simple templating language that allows us to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. Used in parts of our application for server-side rendering.

6. **PostgreSQL**:

   - _Usage_: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used in certain parts of our project, particularly for data requiring complex queries and relational data structures.

7. **Redux.js**:
   - _Usage_: A state management library used in conjunction with React. It helps manage and centralize application state, making it easier to keep track of state changes across the application, particularly in the frontend.

# Future Work

We've learned a lot over the development of this project. However, for our future work of this template, we'd like to:

- Implement advanced security measures like two-factor authentication and regular security audits to bolster user data protection.
- Refine the application's mobile responsiveness and user interface design to ensure a seamless and engaging experience across all devices.
- Expand product functionality with features like user-driven product recommendations, a review and rating system, and enhanced search capabilities to enrich the shopping experience.
